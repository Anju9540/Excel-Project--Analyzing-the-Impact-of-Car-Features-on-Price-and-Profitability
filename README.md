# Analyzing the Impact of Car Features on Price and Profitability - Excel Project 🚗📊

## Overview 📝
This project analyzes how various car features impact pricing and profitability in the automotive industry. Using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, the project uncovers relationships between vehicle attributes and market performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help manufacturers optimize pricing strategies and product development.

## Project Description 📋
The automotive industry has seen rapid changes with increased focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With rising competition and shifting consumer preferences, understanding the factors that drive demand is critical. In this project, a comprehensive dataset containing details such as **make, model, year, engine specifications, fuel type, transmission,** and more is used to answer the key question:

> **How can automobile manufacturers optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?**

By applying various data analysis techniques—including regression analysis and market segmentation—the project identifies which features and market segments are most influential in determining a car’s price.

## Business Problem 💡
- **Consumer Demand:** Determine which car features are most attractive to buyers.
- **Profitability:** Understand the factors driving car pricing to maximize profitability.
- **Decision Making:** Help manufacturers develop pricing strategies and focus on features that enhance market competitiveness.

## Data Analysis Tasks 🔍
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - ❌ Remove rows with null values.
   - 🔄 Delete duplicate entries (715 duplicate records removed).
   - 🎨 Format columns appropriately (e.g., add a dollar sign to MSRP).
   - 🔧 Replace unknown values in the Transmission Type column with the most frequent value (**Automatic**).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - 📊 **Descriptive Analysis:** Understand basic statistics and distributions (e.g., average MSRP by manufacturer).
   - 📈 **Regression Analysis:** Identify relationships between engine power, engine cylinders, and MSRP.
   - 🗂 **Market Segmentation:** Analyze the popularity of car models across different market categories.
   - 🎨 **Visualization:** Create scatter plots, bar charts, stacked column charts, bubble charts, and line charts to illustrate insights.

3. **Dashboard Creation**
   - 📌 Build interactive dashboards using pivot tables and slicers for dynamic data exploration.
   - 📉 Visualize trends in pricing, fuel efficiency, and market segmentation by brand and body style.

## Technology Stack 🖥️
- **Microsoft Excel 2019:** Data cleaning, pivot tables, regression analysis, and visualization.
- **PowerPoint:** For presentation and reporting.
- **OBS Studio:** Used for recording video explanations of the project.

## Approach & Methodology 🔧
- **Data Understanding:** Start with a dataset of 11,915 rows and 16 columns; identify and correct duplicates and missing values.
- **Data Cleaning:** Format the data into tables for efficient analysis; adjust numerical and categorical fields.
- **Analysis Techniques:** Utilize pivot tables for aggregation, regression tools to assess variable importance, and various chart types to uncover trends and correlations.
- **Dashboarding:** Develop interactive dashboards to visualize key performance metrics like MSRP variation by brand, body style, and fuel efficiency trends over time.

## Key Insights & Results 📈
- **Market Trends:** Certain market segments like Hatchback and Flex Fuel are among the most popular, while others (e.g., Flex Fuel Hybrid) are less so.
- **Engine Power & Pricing:** A strong positive relationship exists between engine horsepower and car price.
- **Impactful Features:** Engine cylinders show a significant correlation with pricing, while features like the number of doors have a minimal impact.
- **Brand Analysis:** Brands like Bugatti command higher average prices compared to others.
- **Fuel Efficiency:** An inverse relationship between MPG and engine cylinders suggests that fuel efficiency decreases as the number of cylinders increases.
- **Dashboard Insights:** Visualizations reveal detailed trends, including variation of car prices by brand and body style, and the impact of transmission type on MSRP.
